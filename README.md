## Project Objective
This project aimed to build predictive models using SAS to predict the number of games won by a player looking at multiple performance statistics from the 2023 NBA season. Three predictive models were used in this analysis: multiple linear regression, CART, and neural network. 

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project was from Kaggle (link: https://www.kaggle.com/code/xreina8/predictive-modeling-of-nba-player-performance/input).
